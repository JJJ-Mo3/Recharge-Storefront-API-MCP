## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly:

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT create a public GitHub issue** for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to the project maintainers with:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes (if available)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the reported vulnerability
- **Timeline**: We aim to provide an initial response within 5 business days
- **Resolution**: Critical vulnerabilities will be addressed within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: We follow responsible disclosure practices

### Security Best Practices

When using this MCP server:

#### API Token Security
- **Never commit API tokens** to version control
- Use environment variables or secure secret management
- Rotate API tokens regularly
- Use the minimum required permissions

#### Environment Configuration
- Keep `.env` files out of version control
- Use appropriate tokens for development and production environments
- Implement proper access controls

#### Network Security
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Monitor API usage for anomalies

#### Container Security (Docker)
- Use non-root users in containers
- Keep base images updated
- Implement resource limits
- Use Docker secrets for sensitive data

#### Monitoring and Logging
- Monitor for unusual API usage patterns
- Log security-relevant events
- Implement rate limiting
- Set up alerting for suspicious activity

### Known Security Considerations

1. **API Token Exposure**: Tokens may appear in debug logs - ensure debug mode is disabled in production
2. **Network Traffic**: API communications contain sensitive data - use secure networks
3. **Error Messages**: Error responses may contain sensitive information - sanitize before logging
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement client-side rate limiting to prevent API abuse

### Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2)
- Documented in the changelog
- Announced through GitHub releases
- Include migration instructions if needed

### Compliance

This project follows:
- OWASP security guidelines
- Industry standard security practices
- Secure coding principles
- Regular security assessments
